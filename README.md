# Yabbi
Yabbi is an interpreted, functional, high-level programming language.

This is mostly an educational project. The aim is to create an intepreted language that combines my favorite features of Rust, Python, and JavaScript into a general purpose and fast intepreted language. The interpreter will be written in Rust and later I plan to make a compiler for it as well.

The end result should be a language that is without semantic white space, has optional type declarations, and easily concurrent and asynchronous in execution.
